# Weekly Challenge #24 - Stairs Animation

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that makes a character go up stairs as the user is pressing right.** One of my pet peeves when playing video games is when stairs are involved, the animation almost never look natural. So with this challenge you're going to try an right this wrong :)

### Winners:

* The winner for $100 is @Krayorn! I very rarely get surprised those days but this entry did! Instead of animating the character, why not animate the stairs ðŸ¤¯. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-24-stairs-animations/issues/4

* In second place for $75 is @nikpundik and @giusfalco! The motion of the body walking up the stairs looks realistic and the art is stunning! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-24-stairs-animations/issues/1

* In third place for $50 is @michael-azogu! This entry shows how difficult it is to reproduce human body animation from scratch, the stick figure looks cool! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-24-stairs-animations/issues/3

* Honorable mention for @Nakatox! While the stair climbing animation isn't there, it inspired a really cool minigame, the ending is fun if you can get to it! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-24-stairs-animations/issues/2
